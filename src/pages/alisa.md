# About Alisa

I have a broad background, hard to pin down,
but I revolve around objects, people and places.

Anything put in front of me from the world of consumption, I can manage, 
but I only take on things I believe in.
Things people need, things the planet needs.

I work on consumer goods and experiences from concept to delivery.
Including but not limited to: product research and development, production, copywriting, packaging, interiors.

I like research, I like discovery, 
I like progress but not for the sake of progress alone.

I find the right solutions and producers.
I talk to people to find the way to get things done.

I go into places such as: the factory, the office, the library, the studio, the garage, the printing house.

I have an international network of contacts, 
talkers, thinkers, doers, creators.
If needed, I form teams of people.

My professional background is in:
art, business, design history and production, set design, entrepreneurship, anthropology, writing, editing, curation, architectural restoration, sales, theater, influencer in the old sense of the word.

My personal interests are in:
travel, food, light exercise, art, politics, business, the natural world.

In my output, you won’t find:
Fancy graphs, marketing concepts, waste, nonsense, bloated teams.

You will find:
Sincerity, honesty, things that matter and make a difference,
things people like and believe in.

I am most known for the project KIOSK which I started 16 years ago.

I’m nice, mostly.
I get things done.

if I believe in it.
And I only take on things I believe in.
